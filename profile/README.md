The **G**MRT **H**igh **R**esolution **S**outhern **S**ky (**GHRSS**) survey is
a blind survey for pulsars and radio transients that scans the southern sky
visible from the **G**iant **M**eterwave **R**adio **T**elescope (**GMRT**). The
sky coverage of the survey has been plotted below. The survey was carried out in
two distinct phases: Phase 1, which used the legacy GMRT system with a 32 MHz
bandwidth, centered at 322 MHz, and Phase 2, which is still ongoing, and uses
the upgraded GMRT system, with a 200 MHz bandwidth, centered at 400 MHz.

**GHRSS survey sky coverage and discoveries**: Part of the target sky that has
already been covered by the survey is marked as a deep blue shaded region. Part
of the sky that has not yet been covered by the survey is marked as a light blue
shaded region. **Image Credit** : [Shreya Prabhu (NIUS student)][shreya].

### Discoveries

The table below lists all discoveries from the GHRSS survey; out of these, Phase
1 accounts for 13 discoveries, while Phase 2 accounts for 14 discoveries till
now. A total of 31 discoveries has been made via the survey, which includes 2
MSPs, 2 mildly recycled pulsars, and 3 RRATs (a.k.a. **r**otating **ra**dio
**t**ransients).
